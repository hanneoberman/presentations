<!-- Computational Reproducibility in Statistics -->

<!-- Computational reproducibility—the ability to reproduce results from a study using the original data and analysis code—is a cornerstone of Open Science. It ensures transparency, fosters trust, and enhances the reusability of scientific research. Even with open data and code, many statistical studies are regrettably not reproducible yet. This presentation explores how to teach computational reproducibility to (future) statisticians, focusing on domain-agnostic principles and practical tools. -->

<!-- At Utrecht University, we teach a reproducibility-focused course in the research master’s program 'Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical, and Social Sciences'. The course introduces students to tools and workflows for creating publication-ready research compendia, incorporating (among other things) Quarto markdown, version control with Git, and reproducible R environments using {renv}. Many of the tools taught in this course are also applicable to the work of survey methodologists. For example, R code may be shared as an executable research compendium, R package, or Shiny app. -->

<!-- The key question in this presentation is: How can we promote the adaption of tools for computational reproducibility among statisticians? -->

<!-- # Overview -->

<!-- ## Today's class -->

<!-- - Reproducibility -->
<!-- - Research compendiums -->

<!-- ![](images/lec-4/researchroad.jpg) -->

## Why bother?

We would like our results to be as fully reproducible as possible:

A. **Reproducibility is one of the pillars of science**

  - It is the standard by which to judge scientific claims
  - It helps the cumulative growth of knowledge - no duplication of effort

. . . 

B. **Reproducibility may greatly benefit you**

  - You'll develop better work habits
  - Better teamwork - especially with new team members
  - Changing or amending your work is much easier
  - Higher research impact - more likely to be picked up and cited

> A result is **reproducible** when the *same* analysis steps performed on the *same* dataset consistently produces the *same* answer.

## Definition

> Research results are **replicable** if there is sufficient information available for independent researchers to make the same findings using the same procedures.

## True or false?

In computational sciences - such as statistics - simply having the data and code means that the results are not only replicable, but fully reproducible.

## Reproducibility of `R` scripts

Reproducible research is not the norm: 

> 74% of `R` files failed to complete without error

<!-- 9000 unique R files published from 2010 to 2020 -->

## Making research reproducible

- reproducible documents
- research compendiums

## Teaching reproducibility


![](../../UU_logo.png)

<!-- We teach ‘Markup Languages and Reproducible Programming in Statistics’ in the second year of the Master’s programme ‘Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences’ at Utrecht University (UU). -->

[Markup Languages and Reproducible Programming in Statistics](https://www.gerkovink.com/markup/)

## Course aims

Course aims include the development of a publication-ready reproducible research compendium that contains:

- a typeset manuscript following a markup language,
- data and code, 
- everything that allows for successful reproduction and reuse of the materials (e.g. a license).

. . . 


In our course, students are taught various tools and languages, such as Quarto markdown, version control with git, and reproducible environments for `R` with `renv`.

## Full course aims {.nonincremental}

a. Students develop fundamental knowledge and understanding in the state of the art in statistical markup languages and reproducible programming and development 

b. They can determine the most effective markup strategies to address a typesetting problem 

c. They can efficiently organize a reproducible programming and development process 

d. They can produce repositories up to the standards of international programming and coding conventions and initiatives 

e. They can produce publications up to the typesetting standards of international peer-reviewed journals 

<!-- ## By the end of this class... -->

<!-- - ... you will have heard *what* reproducible research is and *why* it is important -->
<!-- - ... you have *applied* this knowledge by *critiquing* the reproducibility of case study -->
<!-- - ... you will be able to *produce* a reproducible research archive from scratch -->

2. Quarto markdown
3. Version control (with git and GitHub) 
4. Reproducible research in statistics
5. Developer portfolios
6. Re-usable R code (with R packages and Shiny)


## Reusable course elements

<!-- Our course materials draw from resources about the tools and languages that we teach, e.g. software manuals. In principle, these materials are reusable by others who teach reproducibility. But, of course, this is heavily reliant on the specific software framework: in our case, the statistical programming language R. -->

<!-- A more domain agnostic resource that we use is The Turing Way. The Turing Way is a handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science, developed by the Turing Way community. We also use teaching materials from the research data management support workshops offered by the UU library. But... we might be missing some discipline-independent resources for teaching and testing reproducibility for graduate students. -->

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/330px-R_logo.svg.png)

## Missing element(s)?

<!-- We do not yet make use of many domain agnostic initiatives for reproducible research. Just to name a few relevant collections: FORRT, Project TIER, and the Carpentries. But more importantly, we could implement CODECHECK-ing in our course to teach about computational reproducibility. -->

<!-- A CODECHECK is an attempted reproduction of research outcomes by independent execution of the analysis code. The CODECHECK initiative appoints codecheckers to CODECHECK (peer-reviewed) research articles. -->

<!-- In our course, we could teach students how to do a CODECHECK. We could even use CODECHECK-ing as an assessment tool to evaluate whether students meet the learning objectives. Should we? -->

<!-- - Completeness: The research compendium contains all of the objects needed to reproduce a predefined outcome. -->
<!-- - Organization: It is easy to understand and keep track of the various objects in the research compendium and their relationship over time. -->
<!-- - Economy: Fewer extraneous objects in the compendium mean fewer things that can break and require less maintenance over time. -->
<!-- - Transparency: The research compendium provides full disclosure of the research process that produced the scientific claim. -->
<!-- - Documentation: Information describing compendium objects is provided in enough detail to enable independent understanding and use of the compendium. -->
<!-- - Access: It is clear who can use what, how, and under what conditions, with open access preferred. -->
<!-- - Provenance: The origin of the components of the research compendium and how each has changed over time is evident. -->
<!-- - Metadata: Information about the research compendium and its components is embedded in a standardized, machine-readable code. -->
<!-- - Automation: As much as possible, the computational workflow is script- or workflow-based so that the workflow can be re-executed using minimal actions. -->
<!-- - Review: A series of managed activities needed to ensure continued access to and functionality of the research compendium and its components for as long as necessary. -->


## In practice

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gerkovink/markup/refs/heads/main/slides/images/lec-4/rdm.jpeg)
Research Data Management Support workshop: 

[**Writing Reproducible Manuscripts in R and Python**](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/introduction.html)

## Compendium step-by-step

- Think about a good folder structure 
  - Split up 'read-only', 'human-generated', and 'project-generated' files
- Create folder structure (main directory and sub directories)
  - Add a landing page in the form of a README document
  - Make the compendium executable (to automatically generate the results; optional)
  - Make the compendium into a git repository (optional)
- Add all files needed for reproducing the results of the project
  - Avoid 'hard coded' parameters or human intervention in the execution
- Make the compendium as clean and easy to use as possible
  - Include a citation file and a LICENSE file with info on how it can be used
- Publish your compendium
  - E.g. on Zenodo (optional, more on this in the last course week)
