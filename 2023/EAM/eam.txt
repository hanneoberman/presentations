- pull them in: 
Who of you has ever done some statistical consulting for empirical researchers? 
And of you who has *never* come across a real-world dataset with missing values? 
It's always nice to be able to suggest something better than a biasing default such as list-wise deletion, 
but *however advanced* the missing data method that you suggest may be, the issue remains:
missing values are by definition missing. 
It is seldom possible to recover the unobserved true data that is obfuscated by the missingness.
So you may never be certain that the solution you suggested, was the right one.

- build up towards: 
That is, unless you're doing a simulation study. 
In simulation studies, it is possible to start out with a complete dataset and impose missingness yourself.
Then, as the simulator, you're able to determine exactly how well your suggested solution fixes the problem at hand,
within the confined space of the simulation design.

- the big problem: 
But that brings us the the *real* problem I'd like to discuss today: 
simulators create their own missing data problems,
and they do not sufficiently report their simulation designs.
The lack of common ground in evaluating imputation methodology
may lead to suboptimal use in practice, 
because simulation results are not comparable 
and hard to translate into real-world/empirical missing data problems

- explain potential solutions: 
Then just require simulators to report on their designs?

- explain why these are not sufficient: 
MAR may be spurious.

- present the big solution: 
Standardizing the evaluation of the simulation studies!
And sharing (pseudo) code.
To aid fellow simulators, we are developing a checklist.

- and how it solves the problem: 
With standardized evaluation, simulation studies may be
1) better documented
2) more comparable
3) easier to interpret/extrapolate from

- coda: 
And hopefully, with this standardized evaluation, 
you will have more confidence in the suggestions you do as missing data consultant!

# evaluating imputation routines is hard

# come to you with missing data problems.

# one of the nice things about missing data research is creating your own problems

# the empirical researchers you are consulting present you with incomplete data? 

# the simulator is free to create their own missing data problem.
